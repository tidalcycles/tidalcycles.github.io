Emacs is a classic programmer's editor, very well developed but a
little difficult to use at first. For a while Emacs was the only editor that
worked with Tidal, but if you're not feeling confident, you may wish
to try the Atom editor instead, using the instructions above.

#### Emacs under Linux

Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint users can install emacs, along with its
haskell front-end, this way:

~~~~sh
sudo apt-get install emacs24 haskell-mode
~~~~

To install the emacs interface to tidal, you'll need to edit a
configuration file in your home folder called `.emacs`. If it doesn't
exist, create it. Then, add the following, replacing
`~/projects/tidal` with the location of the `tidal.el` file.

~~~~emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/tidal")
(require 'haskell-mode)
(require 'tidal)
~~~~

If tidal.el did not come with this document, you can grab it here: <https://raw.github.com/yaxu/Tidal/master/tidal.el>

Now see under 'Testing, testing' below to check everything is
working.

#### Emacs under Mac OS

Install emacs, and make it appear in your applications folder:

~~~bash
brew install emacs --cocoa
brew linkapps
~~~

Ok now time to configure emacs.. Do the following:

~~~bash
mkdir ~/tidal
cd ~/tidal
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaxu/Tidal/master/tidal.el > tidal.el
~~~

Then create a file in your home folder called .emacs (unless it exists already), then open the file in a text editor and insert the following lines:

~~~emacs
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives 
    '("marmalade" .
      "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
(setq load-path (cons "~/tidal/" load-path))
(require 'tidal)
(setq tidal-interpreter "/usr/local/bin/ghci")
~~~

The above ensures that emacs has access to the extensions in the 'marmalade' repository (in particular, haskell-mode), that the tidal.el file you downloaded earlier is is loaded, and that tidal can find the haskell interpreter.

{% capture haskellplatform %}
**Note:** If you have already installed Haskell using the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/) installer, make the following change to the above:

~~~emacs
(setq tidal-interpreter "/usr/bin/ghci")
~~~
{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.html content=haskellplatform %}

Now start emacs (or if it's already loaded, restart it to make sure .emacs is read), it should be in your Applications folder (if you start it from the terminal it'll probably load an old version). Once emacs has started, press `alt-x` (i.e. hold down `alt` while pressing `x`) and type:

~~~emacs
package-refresh-contents
~~~
Then do `alt-x` again and type:

~~~emacs
package-install
~~~

and then:

~~~emacs
haskell-mode
~~~

Now see under 'Testing, testing' below to check everything is
working.

#### Emacs under Windows

Download Emacs for Windows from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/. Extract the zip file, then simply
run Emacs from `bin\runemacs.exe`.

Next you will need to find or create the `.emacs` file located in your home directory. This is the Emacs config file. Your exact location may vary depending on how Emacs is installed/run. 

1. If you run `runemacs.exe` by double-clicking on it, then your `.emacs` file will probably be located at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\`. 
2. If you put the `runemacs.exe` folder on your path and run it from a command prompt, then your `.emacs` file will probably be located at `c:\users\<username>\`

Be aware of how you started `runemacs.exe`, and create the `.emacs` in the appropriate folder if it does not exist already. 

Alternately, you can try to have Emacs create the `.emacs` file for you automatically by changing a config setting from one of the Emacs menus and saving your configuration. 

Haskell-mode needs to be installed in Emacs. The easiest way to do this in Windows is add the Marmalade package manager in Emacs. There are other ways to install haskell-mode (detailed at https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode), but Marmalade is probably easiest.

Enable Marmalade by adding this to your `.emacs` file:

~~~~emacs
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
~~~~

Refresh the package index by `M-x package-refresh-contents`. Then install haskell-mode via `M-x package-install` [RET] `haskell-mode`.

*Note* the `M-x` key combination is `alt-x` in Windows.

In `.emacs` add this to enable Tidal:

~~~~emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path "c:/projects/tidal")
  (require 'haskell-mode)
  (require 'tidal)
~~~~

... but replace `c:/projects/tidal` with the path to the folder that contains `tidal.el`. `tidal.el` can be obtained from the Tidal repository, at https://github.com/yaxu/Tidal. The easiest way to use it is to clone the Tidal repository and modify the `.emacs` file to use the path where you cloned it:

~~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/yaxu/Tidal c:\tidal
~~~~

then:

~~~~emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path "c:/tidal")
  (require 'haskell-mode)
  (require 'tidal)
~~~~

Now see under 'Testing, testing' below to check everything is
working.

#### Testing, testing...

Now start emacs, and open a new file called something like
"helloworld.tidal". Once the file is opened, you still have to start
tidal, you do that by typing `Ctrl-C` then `Ctrl-S`.

To check everything is working, type the following line, then type
`Ctrl-Enter`:

~~~~haskell
d1 $ brak $ sound "bd sn/2"
~~~~

All being well you'll hear a bass drum and a kick, and can progress to
the 'patterns' menu to start learning Tidal.
