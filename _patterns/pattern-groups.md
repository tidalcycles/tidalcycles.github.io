Use Tidal's _square braces_ syntax to create a pattern grouping:

~~~haskell
d1 $ sound "[bd sn sn] cp"
~~~

Square braces allow several events to be played inside of a single
step. You can think of the above pattern as having two steps, with the
first step broken down into a subpattern, which has three
steps. Practically, this means you can create denser sub-divisions of
samples:

~~~haskell
d1 $ sound "bd [sn sn]"
d1 $ sound "bd [sn sn sn]"
d1 $ sound "bd [sn sn sn sn]"
d1 $ sound "[bd bd] [sn sn sn sn]"
d1 $ sound "[bd bd bd] [sn sn]"
d1 $ sound "[bd bd bd bd] [sn]"
~~~

You can even nest groups inside groups to create very dense and complex
patterns:

~~~haskell
d1 $ sound "[bd bd] [bd [sn [sn sn] sn] sn]"
~~~

### Layering (Polyrhythms) Instead of Grouping

You can also layer up several loops, by using commas to separate the
different parts:

~~~haskell
d1 $ sound "[bd bd bd, sn cp sn cp]"
~~~

This would play the sequence `bd bd bd` at the same time as `sn cp sn
cp`.  Note that the first sequence only has three events, and the
second one has four.  Because tidal ensures both loops fit inside the
same cyclic duration, you end up with a polyrhythm.

You can layer any number of patterns to create many polyrhythms:

~~~haskell
d1 $ sound "[bd bd bd, sn cp sn cp, arpy arpy, odx]"
~~~

And of course you can use groupings inside of the layers:

~~~haskell
d1 $ sound "[bd bd bd, [sn sn] cp, arpy [arpy [arpy arpy] arpy arpy], odx]"
~~~
