There are two steps to starting TidalCycles each time, first starting SuperDirt inside SuperCollider, and then starting TidalCycles inside Atom.

To start SuperDirt, paste the following code into a SuperCollider
window, click on the code, hold down shift and press enter.

~~~~c
SuperDirt.startup
~~~~

To start TidalCycles, open a new window, save it with a filename than ends in `.tidal`, e.g. `test.tidal`, then try running a simple pattern:

~~~~haskell
d1 $ sound “bd sn”
~~~~

n.b. If you see an example starting with `d1` to `d9` change it to be e.g. `s1` instead. This is because you are using the new `SuperDirt` synth.

**If you hear sound, congratulations!** Time to move on to [the tutorial](/patterns.html).

If you get stuck, you are very welcome to ask questions and share
problems on [the forum](http://lurk.org/groups/tidal/), or on the
`#tidal` channel of the
[TOPLAP slack](http://toplap.org/toplap-on-slack/).
