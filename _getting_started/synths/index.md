SuperDirt allows you to trigger and granulate samples, and apply a
range of effects, as well as trigger SuperCollider synths. However
there are alternatives.

One is MIDI software and hardware synths, see the
["howto" page](/howtos.html#midi) for info.

It's also possible to use TidalCycles to send custom Open Sound
Control (OSC) messages. This is not currently documented, but ask in
[the forum or chat system](/community.html) for info, it's not too
tricky.

Another alternative is "classic dirt" - the native sampler that
SuperDirt is based upon. It does not have all the effects that
SuperDirt has, but has its own character, and is more efficient, so
ideal for running on older hardware or "single board computers" such
as the Raspberry PI. You can find installation instructions for Dirt
in its
[github repository](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt/blob/master/README.md).
